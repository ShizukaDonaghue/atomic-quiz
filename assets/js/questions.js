        question: "The three basic components of an atom are?",
        a: "Protons, neutrons, and ions",
        b: "Protons, neutrons, and electrons",
        c: "Protons, neutrinos, and ions",
        d: "Protium, deuterium, and tritium",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: `<p>The three main components of an atom are protons, neutrons, and electrons, and in order to 
        be considered an atom, there needs to be at least a single proton.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "An element is determined by the number of?",
        a: "Atoms",
        b: "Electrons",
        c: "Neutrons",
        d: "Protons",
        answer: "D",
        explanation: `<p>Before scientists knew about the parts of the atom, each element 
        was recognized by its atom's atomic weight. These days, we identify atoms based on how many protons they 
        contain.</p>`,

    {
        question: "The nucleus of an atom consists of?",
        a: "Electrons",
        b: "Neutrons",
        c: "Protons and neutrons",
        d: "Protons, neutrons, and electrons",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: `<p>The core of an atom is its nucleus, which consists of protons and neutrons that stick to each 
        other because of the strong nuclear force.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "A single proton has what electrical charge?",
        a: "No charge",
        b: "Positive charge",
        c: "Negative charge",
        d: "Either a positive or negative charge",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: `<p>A proton has a +1 electrical charge. An electron has a -1 electrical charge. Neutrons are 
        electrical neutral, which means they have no net electrical charge.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "Which particles have approximately the same size and mass as each other?",
        a: "Neutrons and electrons",
        b: "Electrons and protons",
        c: "Protons and neutrons",
        d: "None - all are different in terms of size and mass",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: `<p>Protons and neutrons have nearly the same size and mass. Electrons are so much smaller and 
        lighter they basically don't even affect the mass of an atom.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "Which two particles would be attracted to each other?",
        a: "Electrons and neutrons",
        b: "Electrons and protons",
        c: "Protons and neutrons",
        d: "All particles are attracted to each other",
        answer: "B",
        explanation: `<p>Opposites attract when they have opposite electrical charges, so protons and 
        electrons are attracted to each other. Neutrons are neither attracted to nor repelled by other particles.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "The atomic number of an atom is?",
        a: "The number of electrons",
        b: "The number of neutrons",
        c: "The number of protons",
        d: "The number of protons plus the number of neutrons",
        answer: "C",
        explanation: `<p>The atomic number of an atom is the same as the number of protons it has, e.g.  
        hydrogen has one proton and is atomic number 1. A helium atom has two protons, so the element is atomic 
        number 2.</p>`,
    },
    {
        question: "Changing the number of neutrons of an atom changes its?",
        a: "Isotope",
        b: "Element",
        c: "Ion",
        d: "Charge",
        answer: "A",
        explanation: `<p>Atoms that have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons from each 
        other are called isotopes of that element.</p>`,
