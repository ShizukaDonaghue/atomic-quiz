## UX & Desgin
### Overview
Amazing Atoms has been designed to help users test and improve their knowledge about atoms, regardless of their level of knowledge. The overall objective of the game is for users to have some fun while they learn about atoms.  

### User Stories
As a user,
* I would like to test and improve my knowledge about atoms
* I would like a clean and uncluttered website that is intuitive and easy to navigate
* I would like to be able to play the game on any devices
* I would like to understand how to play the game
* I would like clear visual feedback when I submit my answer so that I know whether my answer is correct
* I would like to know how well I did in the game when finished

### Website Structure
The website consists of two HTML pages. The main page contains all the contents related to the game and the second page is only used in case of 404 error. 

The contents for the game are on a single HTML page and JavaScript scrits in script.js are used to hide and unhide sections of the main page based on the intractions with the user. For example, the landing page is the start section of the main page and when the user clicks on the start button to play the game, the start section is hidden and the game section is displayed. Once the game is initiated, a series of randomised questions is displayed which are stored in questions.js file. 

### Wire Frames
Wireframes were generated using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to visualise the structure of the website. The structure of the finished website is slighly different from the wireframes due to development that occurred during the building process, however, the main structure remained the same.
